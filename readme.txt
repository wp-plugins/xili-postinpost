xili-postinpost provides a triple toolkit to insert post(s) everywhere in webpage. Template tag function, shortcode and widget are available.

== Description ==

*xili-postinpost provides a triple toolkit to insert post(s) everywhere in webpage - outside or inside WP loop - . The displayed post(s) are resulting of queries like those in WP loop but not interfere with main WP loop. Widget contains conditional syntax.*

* Template tag function `xi_postinpost()` - see source ,
* shortcode like `[xilipostinpost query="p=1"]` or like `<blockquote>[xilipostinpost query="cat=3,4,150&showposts=2&lang=en_us"]</blockquote>` as in [About Page](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?page_id=3) at end.
* A shortcode like `<blockquote>[xilipostinpost query="cat=3,4,150&showposts=2" lang="cur"]</blockquote>` with param `lang` set to `cur` give a result according the current language (example: inside an undefined page displayed according browser language).

* and widget with powerful syntax for contextual display of query's result.

are available for developers, authors and webmasters.

In widget (and template tag), if option is set, it is possible to choose display period and expiration date.

In widget (if xili-language active) to combine a query and the current language use params like `[query="cat=14" lang="cur"]` with square bracket`[]` and lang set cur. Don't put *cur* in query. See [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/plugins/xili-postinpost/screenshots/).

For each post of the resulting list, the displayed result is hightly customizable and can contain title, excerpt, content, thumbnail image with or without link to the post as single.

Paging is preserved even if a shortcode is used in a list of posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is  - xili-postinpost - versus  - Recent Posts - delivered by WP as default widget ? =

**Recent Posts** only displays title with link of latest posts from all categories.
With **xili-postinpost** it is possible to choose what to display and which categories or tags associated with post (and html tags or class).

= In template tag `xi_postinpost`: is it possible to use query passed as array ? =

YES, see below an example using array and userfunction (formatting the result of query differently than default) :

`
<?php echo xi_postinpost( array( 'showposts' => '4' , 'query' => array( 'category__and' => array( $cat_id, 7 ) ), 'userfunction' => 'xili_pip_banner' ) ); ?>

`
= What is - conditional - display ? =

Currently the result of widget is ever displayed. Here it is possible to use function (currents or made by webmaster) to decide when to display according context. By example if you use `is_page`, if the condition return true, the widget show the result here when a page is displayed in website. Another example with `is_category` and params `1,5,87` in the query input : when one these three categories is shown, the widget show the resulting list.

= What happens if the condition is not true ? =

If the condition is false, you can decide to show result of another query. If the condition is not inside the conditional template tags, it is possible
to create and use a conditional function created by you (in functions.php).

= In widget, what is the code to see latest posts in current language ?
Very simple : `[lang='cur']`

= In widget, what is the code to select two queries according current language ?
In this case, condition uses a function available with xili_language :

`[condition='is_xili_curlang' param='fr_fr' query='p=4953']:[query='p=4972']`

param `fr_fr` is passed to function `is_xili_curlang`, so the first query is fired only if french webpage.
The result adapts and displays the content (can be image+text) according webpage language.

= When using shortcode, the result display excerpt under the title, why ? =

See the topic [here in forum](http://forum2.dev.xiligroup.com/topic.php?id=60)

= What is - from to - feature introduced in 0.9.2 ? =
The webmaster is able to define a period (a slot) when the widget is visible in sidebar (or the shortcode is display inside the content). By example: for an advertising post or an article for a future meeting which disappears the day after the meeting (expiration date).

= Is xili-post-in-post compatible with xili-language trilogy ? =

Yes, visit [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/) and look on the right sidebar or go in WordPress [repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=xili&sort=).

= Why this plugin ? =

xili-postinpost is compromise between minimum php coding (but not accessible by everybody) and end-user tool (like widget) *- but with lot of php lines in background -* to afford flexibility for webmaster and data-designer for CMS. The core function of the plugin ( `xi_postinpost()` ) and its rich argument (array with lot params) was created 4 years ago to insert by example a recent news in header, a target post inside blockquote set in content of a page or a post. Doing a public version is like finishing a book. Remind that free code is not gratis, include fees in quotation for commercial use or clients and donate. For free use, send an email!

= Are the queries recursive in widget ? =
No, it is only possible to combine one true and another one if the first is false: the syntax is `[condition=… query=…]:[query=…]`. The second part can have is own condition as in screenshot 6.


== Upgrade Notice ==
Please read the readme.txt before.
As usually, don't forget to backup the database before major upgrade or testing no-current version found in *other versions* tabs.
Upgrading can be easily procedeed through WP admin UI or through ftp.
